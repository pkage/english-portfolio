		<p>Watching Louis CK’s skit on the N word from his 2008 show <i>Chewed Up</i>, it’s easy to see George Carlin’s influence on him as a comedian. George Carlin’s philosophy was that comedic material had to be thrown out every year and rewritten. In Louis CK’s own words, “this left him with no way but deeper into himself.” This led to Carlin’s act becoming less humour focused and more focused on social issues. Louis CK has been following the same philosophy, and we’re starting to see it come out here. He’s beginning to address social issues, and like Carlin before him, he will continue to do so as long as he is able.</p>

		<p>Dave Chappelle and Nella Larsen are both exploring the issue of “passing” in their respective works of art. Nella Larsen’s portrays passing as another race in an overtly negative fashion in “Passing,” going as far as to make it the critical plot point that the rest of the book revolves around. However, Dave Chappelle uses passing as another race as a tool with which to harpoon white supremacy movements, and passing itself takes a backseat to that.</p>
		<p>This difference in approach is largely due to the different nature of Nella Larsen’s work and Dave Chappelle’s work. Nella Larsen’s novels are focused on social drama, which is less suited to comedy than something like Dave Chappelle’s comedic works</p>
		<h3 class="grey-text text-lighten-3">February 12<sup>th</sup></h3>
		<p><b class="box">connection</b> So far, Passing appears to be similar to most Victorian-era novels in that the main action of the story is dry social maneuvering. Personally, I’ve never seen the appeal of these kinds of books. It’s like a soap opera, but more drawn out. </p>

		<p><b class="box">question</b> Where is this story set?</p>
		<p><b class="box">connection</b> The writing style of this story reminds me strongly of Oscar Wilde’s style of writing. Perhaps this is a common style for this time period. At any rate, both Wilde and Chopin have a knack for being excessively wordy and drawn out. This has the effect of slowing down reading, making it confusing, and ultimately promotes skipping through it.</p>

		<p><b class="box">connection</b> The first few paragraphs reminded me strongly of some of the first signs of psychopathy. What really stood out to me was the wanton cruelty to animals, in addition to the fractured marriage and the drinking problem. As Malcolm Forbes of Forbes Magazine said in 1972, “You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.” This animal cruelty hints at a lack of humanity, and could potentially be dangerous (think axe murderer).</p>

		<p>Walt Whitman’s poetry is significantly different from Emily Dickinson’s poetry for two reasons: structure, and tone. The main and most obvious difference between Dickinson’s poetry and Whitman’s poetry is the structure of the poem itself. A recurring theme in Dickinson’s poetry is the four line stanza; while some short poems are singular six-line stanzas, the majority are split into four line stanzas. This is at odds with Whitman’s poetry, which has frequent and drastic variations in stanza length. The second difference is their tone: Whitman almost always uses a first person perspective (almost every poem is from his perspective or mentions him in some way) while Dickinson jumps between first and third in her poems.</p>

		<h3 class="grey-text text-lighten-3">December 11<sup>th</sup></h3>
		<p>It’s interesting to observe how this concept of self-promotion evolved over time. In Whitman’s day, self promotion was not as prevalent as it is today; people were expected to be humble. Whitman was breaking new ground by publishing a new book that was almost entirely self-promotional. Today, it seems as though we’ve hit the logical extreme of self-promotion. As quoted in the article, Kanye West said, "For me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself."</p>

		<h3 class="grey-text text-lighten-3">December 4<sup>th</sup></h3>
		<p><b class="box">quotation</b> “Yet an uncomfortable starting point is to understand that racial stereotyping remains ubiquitous, and that the challenge is not a small number of twisted white supremacists but something infinitely more subtle and complex: People who believe in equality but who act in ways that perpetuate bias and inequality.”</p>
		<p><b class="box">question</b> What are some ways we can combat this?</p>

		<h3 class="grey-text text-lighten-3">December 3<sup>rd</sup></h3>
		<p><b class="box">quotation</b> “The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies.”</p>
		<p><b class="box">question</b> Did Thoreau know how influential his words would become?</p>
		<p><b class="box">connection</b> Track 4 on Run the Jewels’ self-titled album Run the Jewels 2, “Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck) embodies a lot of the ideas in Henry David Thoreau’s essay “Civil Disobedience”. “Civil Disobedience” lays the foundations for most anarchism, and “Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)” promotes the destruction of society. For example, in verse 1, Killer Mike raps “…And take over a jail, give them COs hell/The burnin’ of the sulfur, goddamn I love the smell/Now get to pillow torchin’, where the fuck is the warden?”, clearly advocating a prison riot (a classic example of anarchy).</p>

		<h1>emily dickinson’s poetry and computer programming: a comparison</h1>
		<p>Picture Emily Dickinson standing in a window in Amherst, gazing out at nineteenth century America, trying to figure out how to phrase her latest poem. Now, fast forward a century and a half. Picture a computer science undergraduate at Amherst College churning out hundreds of lines of code at four in the morning, fueled by an almost manic energy derived from coffee and energy drinks in order to finish their degree. It would seem that these two scenarios are dissimilar similar, and in part this is true. However, while at first glance Emily Dickinson’s poetry and computer programming seem to have nothing in common, they do share some common properties and themes.</p>
		<p>One of the common properties shared between programming and Dickinson’s poetry is the use of symbols to represent ideas. One common theme throughout Dickinson’s poetry is the use of the dash to indicate a break. An excellent example of this is in her poem “Come slowly - Eden!”:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Come slowly - Eden!<br>
			Lips unused to Thee -<br>
			Bashful - sip thy Jessamines -<br>
			As the fainting Bee -<br>
			<br>
			Reaching late his flower,<br>
			Round her chamber hums -<br>
			Counts his nectars -<br>
			Enters - and is lost in Balms.
		</blockquote>
		<p>The dash is used in this poem to indicate a break and effectively fragments the poem into discrete elements. The dashes provide a unique reading experience, and it is possible this is how the poems would be read aloud. In most programming languages, a similar construct is used. Consider this simple program in the C++ programming language:</p>
		<blockquote><code>
				#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
				#include &lt;string&gt;<br>
				int main() {<br>
				std::cout &lt;&lt; &ldquo;hello, world!\nwhat&rsquo;s your name? &rdquo;;<br>
				string name;<br>
				std::cin &gt;&gt; name;<br>
				std::cout &lt;&lt; &ldquo;hello, &ldquo; &lt;&lt; name;<br>
				return 0;<br>
				}
		</code></blockquote>
		<p>Here, the semicolon is used to break up the program into individual lines so that it can be processed by the compiler into assembly and eventually a binary image. Another similarity is the use of the symbol. In C++, the semicolon only sometimes used in accordance with the constructs of the language (only to be used after statements, definitions, and calls but not after preprocessor directives). In Dickinson’s poetry, the dash is used to break up the poem into exclamatory segments.</p>
		<p>Another way that Dickinson’s poetry is similar to programming is the concept of subtly hidden complexity. This is the notion that on the surface poems and programs alike appear simple, but can reference incredibly complicated concepts. The first stanza of Dickinson’s poem “I know that He exists” demonstrates this complexity:</p>
		<blockquote>
			I know that He exists.<br>
			Somewhere - in silence -<br>
			He has hid his rare life<br>
			From our gross eyes.
		</blockquote>
		<p>Here, Dickinson uses references to faith and God to proclaim that even while God has gone into hiding from the human race, she remains convinced of his existence. This is obviously a nuanced topic, as many scholars have differing opinions. It calls to mind images of churches, spirituality, and faith. Similarly, a short program can call into action an incredibly complex process. Consider this short chunk of HTML: </p>
		<blockquote><code>
				&lt;html&gt;<br>
				&lt;head&gt;<br>
				&lt;title&gt;Example essay website&lt;/title&gt;<br>
				&lt;/head&gt;<br>
				&lt;body&gt;<br>
				&lt;p&gt;please send help it&rsquo;s five in the morning&lt;/p&gt;<br>
				&lt;/body&gt;<br>
				&lt;/html&gt;
		</code></blockquote>
		<p>This relatively simplistic code defines a simple web page with a title and a paragraph element. When you navigate to this site, a chain of events are kicked into motion. Your processor begins screaming away at billions of cycles per second frantically running the XNU kernel, which in turn is churning through the POSIX spec-related abstractions to create the Darwin system, which in turn is running OSX. OSX in turn is rendering the WebKit engine, which is being controlled by Chrome, which is also controlling the network card (through OSX) in order to download the page. Once it downloads the page, it steps through the file and builds a document object model (DOM) which is passed through WebKit where it is transformed into a renderable object. This object is passed to the GPU along with some drawing information which draws it to the screen. All of this is referenced in those eight lines of code.</p>
		<p>One area where Dickinson’s poetry and programming languages differ greatly is the flexibility of their interpretations. In Dickinson’s poetry (and in many other poet’s poetry), a large amount is open to the reader’s interpretation. Consider Dickinson’s poem “ ‘Faith’ is a fine invention”:One area where Dickinson’s poetry and programming languages differ greatly is the flexibility of their interpretations. In Dickinson’s poetry (and in many other poet’s poetry), a large amount is open to the reader’s interpretation. Consider Dickinson’s poem “ ‘Faith’ is a fine invention”:</p>
		<blockquote>
			“Faith” is a fine invention<br>
			For Gentlemen who see!<br>
			But Microscopes are prudent<br>
			In an Emergency!<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>This poem is open to interpretation. Is she referencing some scientific event? Is she talking about the practice of ignoring reality for faith? It is up to the reader to decide. On the other hand, programming leaves little room for interpretation. Computers are notorious for doing exactly what they are instructed to do, leaving many users wishing for a “do what I mean, not what I say” button. Computers, and particularly compilers, will completely fail when dealing with unspecific input or undefined behavior, often refusing to work at all in the presence of these conditions.</p>
		<p>There are some (albeit few) similarities between computer programming and Dickinson’s poetry, however, the differences far outnumber the similarities. Poems rarely control robots and drive cars, while programming does both. On the other hand, poems can control people.</p>

		<h1>Dear Mr. Arcand,</h1>

	<p>Winter term has been a time of discovery and learning for me. Though it has been packed with things to do and people to see on top of being bisected by winter break, this term’s English class appears to have gone well for me. I’ve grown as a writer and as a contributing member of class. Of course, this is a highly subjective analysis as English is a highly subjective subject. You may think differently, and that’s okay for now. By the end of this essay, you’ll come around to my way of thinking.</p>
	<p>Of course, this wouldn’t be a reflective essay without some unwarranted self-loathing. The best example of this would be the essay about Emily Dickinson’s poetry and its similarities to computer programming. Even though I thought I had produced a good quality essay, I still marked myself as scoring an 85/100. The reason I did this was because I thought that there was no way I could produce an essay worth reading, and that slipped into my self-evaluation process. Thankfully, you stepped in and gave me a 93/100, which I’m grateful for.</p>
	<p>I believe I’ve earned at the very least a B+ for this term’s effort in English class. I’ve worked my very hardest to become a better student than before, and I think I’ve achieved that goal. I’ve worked hard to consistently bring my best into every class. I’ve worked even harder to resist the temptation to hide under a (proverbial) rock in class discussions instead of participating (no mean feat due to social anxiety). I’ve worked harder still at eliminating electronic distractions from class, which wasn’t easy due to a lifelong love of computers coupled with an urge to always do something with my hands.</p>
	<p>Hopefully by now you’re convinced of my term grade. If by some chance you’re not, here’s one more example. I’ve put effort into making sure that writing assignments and revisions are completed in a timely and error-free manner. While this hasn’t always been a success, it’s a start nonetheless and I feel it deserves recognition.</p>
	<br><b>Term Grade: &gt;B+</b>

		<h1>factual origins of fiction</h1>
		<p>The fiction we read often has a large effect on our lives. As such, it’s important to understand where this fiction originates. Authors draw from reality to create their works of fiction, and almost all works of fiction have their roots in either factual places or events. Authors also try to put themselves into their works to give them more character.</p>
		<p>Edgar Allan Poe’s 1843 work “The Black Cat” is a good example of a work of fiction with factual roots. Despite featuring supernatural elements, this short story contains many of Poe’s personality traits and vices. The narrator in “The Black Cat” is heavily against alcoholism and goes to great lengths to show how damaging it is (as evidenced by his frequent “for what disease is like Alcohol” (<a href="http://poestories.com/read/blackcat" target="_blank">Poe</a>)). This is rooted in reality, as Poe was rumored to have an issue with alcohol dependence. It even appears that Poe died of alcoholism, while the medical records surrounding his death have been lost, the newspapers reported that his death was caused by “cerebral inflammation” and “congestion of the brain” (at the time common euphemisms for alcoholism).</p>
		<p>	Almost forty years before “The Black Cat”, Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1804 work “The Minister’s Black Veil” draws even more heavily from factual events and locations. Though never mentioned directly in the story, the setting of “The Minister’s Black Veil” seems to be a town  similar to Salem, Massachusetts, where Hawthorne was born and raised. The similarities between fact and fiction don’t end there: “The Minister’s Black Veil” draws a lot of inspiration from a real man known as Handkerchief Moody who, like the minister in the story, wore a handkerchief over his face. Handkerchief Moody wore his handkerchief after accidentally murdering his friend, starting after the funeral and never taking it off for the rest of his life. The minister in the story also starts wearing the veil and keeps it on until his funeral.</p>
		<p>Two hundred and ten years after “The Minister’s Black Veil”, fiction with a basis in fact is being reported as fact by major news corporations to fit certain agendas. The best example of this is conservative media that panders to the 50+ age demographic. Due to the nature of conservative republican viewpoints, these media outlets have to distort reality to fit the narrative of their viewers because viewers bring advertising revenue. Nancy Grace’s creatively named HLN show Nancy Grace is arguably the worst offender in this category, bending the truth and sometimes outright lying about hot-button issues to attract viewers. For example, her stance on recreational marijuana is that it turns people into monsters and killers (as famously seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WebcNn86s">here</a>). This, of course, is blatantly untrue. However, there is a basis in fact: some people do in fact smoke marijuana to deal with withdrawals from hard drugs or prescription abuse, and this often leads to THC in the systems of violent criminals.</p>
		<p>	In conclusion, the fiction that we read often has a basis in reality. Whether the author derives inspiration from real events or real places, the outcome is a work of fiction that can often have a large effect on our lives.</p>
